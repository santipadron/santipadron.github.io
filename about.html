        <p>(25-03-22) I'm Santiago, currently a student at CÃ©gep de Saint-Laurent in Music and Science. 
            As you can probably tell, I like music, and I like science! I also like programming and computers. 
            Basically, I'm what you may call "a person of many passions."<br>
            <br>Whenever I'm bored, I like to write down whatever comes to my mind, so i made this blog in order to archive all of that stuff that my brains throws at me sometimes.
            It's kinda like a digital Moleskine, and I do it all myself so yes, i purposefully made the decision to make it ultra simple.
            Enjoy! <br><img src="metro.jpg" alt="that's me" height="400"><br> - Santi :)
